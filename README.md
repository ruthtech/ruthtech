### This is an example of a customized GitHub landing page
When I first heard that GitHub added the ability to customize the profile's
landing page, I imagined something like a fully-customizable home page. Nope. 
It means that your landing page displays the README.md from your self-named 
repository. Nice.

To customize your GitHub landing page, create a repository that has the same name as your
username, and add a README.md in it. That's it. 

For example, my username is _ruthtech_, and this is what I did:
1. I had an existing repository named _ruthtech_, which held my portfolio. First I renamed that 
   repository to _ruthlee_.
2. Then I created a new repository named _ruthtech_, and added a README.md.
3. I edited my profile in GitHub to update all former links to _ruthlee_, updated paths
   in my portfolio code, and redeployed my React portfolio code.

#### Formatting the GitHub README.md
These docs explain the formatting that GitHub supports in its README.md files: 
* [Writing on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github)
* [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)  
* [Emojis on GitHub](https://github.com/ikatyang/emoji-cheat-sheet/blob/master/README.md)

#### Hosting your portfolio on GitHub  
If you want to host a website on GitHub, you need to learn GitHub Pages.
To see an example of this, view my portfolio pages in the _About Me_ section.
* [GitHub Pages Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/about-github-pages)
