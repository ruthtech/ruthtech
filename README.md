### This is an example of a customized GitHub landing page
When I first heard that GitHub added the ability to customize the profile's
landing page, I imagined something like a fully-customizable home page. Nope. 
It means that your landing page displays the README.md from your self-named 
repository. Nice.

These docs explain the formatting that GitHub supports in its README.md files.

If you want to host a website on GitHub, you need to learn GitHub Pages.
To see an example of this, view my portfolio pages.
